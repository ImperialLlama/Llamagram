# Llamagram
Llamagram is a photo-sharing application (like Instagram, hence the name) built using the Firebase 
SDK and using the Firebase Real Time Database, Authentication system and storage solution.

It supports registration using a Google account or email, uploading photos and seeing them in a 
scrolling feed and voting on them.
